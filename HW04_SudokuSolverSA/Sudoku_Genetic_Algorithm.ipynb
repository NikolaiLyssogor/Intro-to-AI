At this size or greater it wouldn't converge to a single configuration anymore. Larger sizes beyond this didn't produce an improvement in performance. In this version, the program solves easy boards in a single generation, but consistently peaks at a fitness of around -4 for medium and hard puzzles. The types of local maxima the board gets stuck in are very particular: Though they only have a few conflicts, resolving one conflict creates another ad infinitum. I added a feature where if no improvement was seen over some number of generations, then the next generation would consist of some of the highest-fitness boards from that generation, with the rest being a new set of random boards. This did not improve performance in the amount of time I was letting the program run. "

    "## Summary of Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version used a very straightforward an naive strategy. There was no mutation function, the crossover function swapped three random rows between parents to produce children, and the population was only 50. The population converged *on a single board configuration* within 5 or 6 generations on average. The problem here was twofold: First, the softmax function, which I used to map the fitness of a generation to a selection probability, is really sensitive to variance. So if the range of fitness scores in the initial population was 15, for example, the board with the highest score would have a pobability of being chosen of around 0.9 *even if the next highest board's fitness was only one point lower.* What I did to fix this was increase the population to a value in the thousands, and divide the fitness of the boards by the standard deviation of the population before applying the softmax function. This alone saw the average best fitness after running the algorithm half from around -40 to around -20. When playing around with the population size in this iteration and the final one, I noticed that increasing it beyond 2000 boards didn't show better results in terms of fitness. The next thing to do at this stage was write a crossover function that swapped columns and blocks in addition to rows, and also add a mutation function. Doing this brought the average fitness up to more than -10 from a previous best of -20 on average. At this point I figured that if there are only a handful of conflicts left I could resolve them manually by searching for them and changing their value to the one missing from that row or column. This is the function `test_mutate`. However, I realized by studying some of the high-fitness boards that the algorithm would produce that resolving a conflict would *always* create another one, so the configuration was truly a local max. I added a feature where if the global best fitness score didn't improve over five generations then I would keep the best 500 boards and replace the rest with randomly initialized ones. This strategy didn't have any noticable impact over a 40-generation run, since the fitness would usually bottom out around gereration 30 and I only have so much patience.    "

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a more effective way to solve Sukoku boards of this size than genetic algorithms or simulated annealing. For tougher puzzles, there is too much luck required to solve boards by these advanced guess-and-check methods, given there seems to be a large number of local maxima very close to a fitness of zero. The main insight I took away from doing this project is that the art of implementing genetic algorithms and simulated annealing is in getting them to converge at the right rate. This means keeping the population sufficiently diverse while having a system which guarantees improvement. Another interesting observation is that GA, unlike simulated annealing, appears to increase fitness linearly right up until it converges on a local maximum. There is no phase change period where most of the improvement is seen. "
